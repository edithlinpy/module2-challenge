# module2-challenge

## Description

This Module 2 Challenge is building a portfolio of work that showcase my skills and talents to employers.

The portfolio page presents my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and contact details.

In the work section, instead of using real application details, placeholder images and names are shown. 

In this module, flexbox, grid, media media queries skills have been applied.

## Installation

## Usage

1. When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

2. When a user mouse over an image in the Work section, the cover color will be fully transparent.

3. When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application. (Coming soon)

4. When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport. (screen size < 768px)
